# Zabbix Templates

In templates you will find what we use to monitor our client using zabbix :

- backuppc
- ldap
- dhcpd
- smart status
- mdadm status

and some more.

For some of this template, discovery rules must be put in the agent.
Related scripts can be found on our [puppet module for Zabbix](https://github.com/alkivi-sas/puppet-zabbix)
